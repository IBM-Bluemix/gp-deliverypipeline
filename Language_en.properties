ExtName=IBM Full Globalization Pipeline
ExtDesc=IBM Globalization Pipeline provides machine translation and editing capabilities that enable you to rapidly create, maintain, and revise translations for your Bluemixâ„¢ application. This extension allows for the application developer to dynamically translate property files using machine translation. The application developer can either include updated property files directly in the application package, or the application can use dynamic resource bundles for real-time lookup of strings.

INPUT_PATTERN_KEY=Source file name
INPUT_PATTERN_DESC=Identifies the name of the input files to be translated. Uses Linux find to identify any files that match this name within the source code. For example, 'Language_en.properties' will match any file of that name in sub directories. If there are multiple files that match this name, multiple globalization bundles will be created.  

# Chose what languages to translate to
LANGUAGES_KEY=Target Languages
LANGUAGES_DESC=Accepts a space separated list of languages to target or the keyword "ALL" or "LIST". "ALL" will target all available languages. "LIST" will cause the job to list the available target languages and then exit with a failure code.

SUBMISSION_NAME_KEY=Globalization bundle prefix 
SUBMISSION_NAME_DESC=The prefix used when creating the name of the Globalization Pipeline bundle to be submitted. The name of the bundle on the Globalization Delivery service dashboard will be constructed using this value using the format [prefix].path.to.source.file
